# Learning Robot Skills with Temporal Variational Inference

### What is this? ###

This repository has code for our ICML 2020 paper on [Learning Robot Skills with Temporal Variational Inference](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2847-Paper.pdf), authored by Tanmay Shankar and Abhinav Gupta.

### I want a TL;DR of what this paper does. ###

Our paper presents a way to jointly learn robot skills and how to use them from demonstrations in an unsupervised manner. 
The code implements the training procedure for this across 3 different datasets, and provides tools to visualize the learnt skills.

### Cool. Can I use your code? ###

Yes! If you would like to use our code, please cite our paper and this repository in your work.

### I need help, or I have brilliant ideas to make this code even better. ###

Great! Feel free to mail Tanmay (tanmay.shankar@gmail.com), for help, suggestions, questions and feedback.
