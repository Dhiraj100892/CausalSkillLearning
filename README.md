# Learning Robot Skills with Temporal Variational Inference

This repository has code for our ICML 2020 paper on [Learning Robot Skills with Temporal Variational Inference](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2847-Paper.pdf). 

In the paper (and this code), we jointly learn robot skills and how to use them, from demonstrations in an unsupervised manner.
